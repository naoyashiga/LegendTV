NVActivityIndicatorView
===================

# Introduction
NVActivityIndicatorView is a collection of nice loading animations.

This is original a fork from [DGActivityIndicatorView](https://github.com/gontovnik/DGActivityIndicatorView), inspired by [Loaders.css](https://github.com/ConnorAtherton/loaders.css), written in Swift with full implementation of animations.

You also find Objective-C version of this [here](https://github.com/ninjaprox/DGActivityIndicatorView).
